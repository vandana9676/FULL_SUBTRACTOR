# FULL_SUBTRACTOR
# AIM:
To simulate and synthesis full subtractor using vivado.
# APPARATUS REQUIRED:
vivado 2023.2 software.
# PROCEDURE:
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

# VERILOG CODE:
module full_sub(a,b,bin,diff,borrow);

input a,b,bin;

output diff,borrow;

wire w1,w2,w3;

xor g1(w1,a,bin);

and g2(w2,~a,b);

xor g3(diff,w1,bin);

or g4(borrow,w2,w3);

and g5(w3,~w1,bin);

endmodule

# RESULT:
Thus the verilog program for full subtractor has been simulated and verified successfully.
